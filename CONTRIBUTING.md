# Contributing to Haystack Editor

Welcome to Haystack Editor!

Haystack is a fork of VS Code and as such, is a complicated and old codebase. Contributing to Haystack would be a great opportunity to improve your TypeScript or design muscles!

## How to contribute

1. Join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/apFrN6ABxc)
2. Give us your feedback! We would love to hear about any bugs you've encountered or any features you want. This is important to just establish a relationship with us.
3. Contribute a test, documentation changes to the codebase, or alternatively ping us about how the codebase works. This demonstrates that you understand the codebase and are proficient enough to make changes in it.
4. After steps 1-3, you may contribute to the codebase. Please coordinate with us on Discord beforehand to prevent duplication of work and to see whether what you're working on is feasible.

## Before creating a pull request

Please make sure to:

- Install ESLint and Prettier in your IDE and follow the code format of the code base (e.g. no semicolons, no tabs, etc.).
- Ensure all dependencies are in the correct `package.json` files.
- Create a Pull Request from your individual branch titled {user_name}/{feature_or_bug} (e.g. akshaysg14/group-editors).
- Ensure the PR is ready for review. If you want to discuss WIP code, mark it as a draft.
